# HCF Faction Plugin

This project is a plugin for a Minecraft server based on the **Hardcore Factions (HCF)** mode. It is designed to manage factions, their interactions, and associated data, with integration to a **MySQL** database for persistent storage. 

_A read-only API is also included to expose faction data on an external website._ (**SOON**)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL properties**  
   Update the file `src/main/resources/config.yml` with your MySQL database details:  
   ```yaml
   database:
     host: localhost
     port: 3306
     name: database
     user: username
     password: password
   ```

3. **Build the plugin**  
   Use Gradle to compile the plugin into a JAR file:  
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```  
   The compiled file will be located in `build/libs`.

4. **Add the plugin to your server**

5. **Start the server**  
   Launch your Minecraft server. The plugin will automatically generate the required tables in your database.
